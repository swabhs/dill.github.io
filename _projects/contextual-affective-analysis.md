Our work takes a people-centric approach to understand subtle connotations in narrative text. By quantifying how people are portrayed in different contexts, we can analyze narratives for signs of bias. To quantitatively measure people's portrayals, we draw from social psychology theories suggesting that *sentiment* (good-bad), *power* (dominant-submissive), and *agency* (active-passive) are the most important dimensions of *affective* meaning. 

Our methodology involves using verb-annotations to score people along these dimensions. Our initial work analyzes media coverage of the #MeToo movement, revealing that women are often portrayed as less powerful than men in these narratives, despite the common perception of the movement as empowering. In subsequent work, we incorporate noun and adjective annotations to analyze media bias more generally. Furthermore, our current work involves gathering new data sets, facilitating analysis across languages, and allowing us to analyze how LGBT people are portrayed in different languages on Wikipedia.
