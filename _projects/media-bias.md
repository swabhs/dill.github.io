title: "Influence Campaigns: Agenda Setting Online, Social Movements, Polarization"

description: |
  We are investigating media bias through a highly multidisciplinary approach that combines elements from NLP, political science, and economics. We are also working to identify false information spread on social networks through phylogeny analysis.

Modern technology has made news spread faster than ever, but with these advances come concerns about credibility and bias. While "fake news" stories can be fact checked, how can we identify news that is one-sided, misleading, or over-reported? In this project, we are investigating media bias through a highly multidisciplinary approach that combines elements from NLP, political science, and economics. We examine agenda-setting (what topics are reported) and framing (how topics are reported) and consider how these concepts can be used to manipulate public opinion.

## Understanding the BLM Movements with Emotions

## Phylogeny Analysis
This research project aims to address the problem of phylogeny analysis of small text messages posted on social media platforms, showing how this solution can help in the identification of false information spread on social networks. Differently from what has been done with longer texts, we will rely upon data-driven approaches, exploiting recent advances of deep neural networks in the fields of Natural Language Processing and pattern recognition.

This research is expected to produce outcomes that can be used by many actors. For example, social media platforms could directly apply the techniques developed to bring higher reliability and also transparency to the published data. People could also deploy them to verify the accuracy of the information posted on social networks and news portals. Moreover, this research can provide appropriate tools to achieve another level of understanding regarding online posts, taking into consideration their spread and power of influence.
