We design a Spanish-English code-mixing dialogue system which uses several strategies (content, structure, and social) when talking to crowdsourced Spanish-English bilinguals. We present findings from the elicited text conversations that will inform how future dialogue systems can incorporate prevalent and nuanced strategies of code-mixing into more human-like and adaptable dialogue systems.
