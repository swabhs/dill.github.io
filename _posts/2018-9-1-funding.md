Thank you to NSF for funding our joint project with [Noah Smith](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/), [Nathan Schneider](http://people.cs.georgetown.edu/nschneid/), and [Shuly Wintner](http://cs.haifa.ac.il/~shuly/Shuly_Wintner/Home.html) "Modeling Crosslinguistic Influences Between Language Varieties". The project will study semantic differences between varieties of English spoken by multilinguals of different backgrounds, and examine the biases of NLP tools when applied to different varieties.
